<A name="Asymmetric Cryptography"></A>Asymmetric Cryptography
</td>
<td>
A form of cryptography in which the 'key' is generated as a key pair: if one key is used for encryption
only the other can be used to decrypt, and vice versa.
<p>
Using asymmetric cryptography, the problem of key distribution becomes one of authentication; i.e. how to make sure
that a given key really does belong to the entity that claims to own it.

A class of <A HREF="#Symmetric Cryptography">symmetric algorithm</A> in which several bits of the input data

The cipher and its mode of operation define the block size: 
the plaintext is split up into appropriately-sized blocks and each block is fed into the cipher.

</td>
<td>
An organization which perform the following functions in a hierachical <A HREF="#Public Key Infrastructure">PKI</A>:
<ul>
<li>
providing trusted ‘root’ certificates to users (<A HREF="#End Entities">End Entities</A>), by 
supplying them with the CA’s public key via out-of-band means.
</li>
<li>
certifying End Entities by generating and distributing certificates for them. 
The certified EE is the subject of the certificate: the CA is the issuer.
</li>
<li>
supporting certificate <A HREF="#Revocation">revocation</A> and revocation checking: if an EE suspects that their key has 
been compromised, they contact the CA which issued it, who should revoke their certificate.
</li>
</ul>
<p>A CA will always have a root certificate-signing key pair, which must be authenticated to End Entities via
out of band channels. This key pair is not logically certified by anything, but it is usually distributed inside 
a <A HREF="#Self-signed Certificate">self-signed certificate</A> to afford some degree of <A HREF="#Tamper Evidency">tamper evidency</A>. 
<p>However, CAs do not have to use their root key pair to issue certificates directly to End Entities. For organizational 
reasons and to reduce the exposure of keys, a CA may have a single root signing key pair, which it uses to certify a 
set of subordinate key pairs, which in turn are used to certify End Entities. Also, CAs may certify the 
signing keys of other CAs by issuing <A HREF="#Cross Certificate">cross certificates</A>, which enable interoperation 
between two distinct PKIs.

Hash algorithms take a variable-length input and produce a fixed length output known as a digest, or hash, of the input.

it should not be possible to deduce the input from the digest, or even any part of the input.
 Also, it should be hard to find collisions: that is, two different inputs which produce the same output.

<p>A way of modelling real-world trust relationships which enables users of <A HREF="#Public Key Cryptography">public key cryptography</A>

<ul>

a <A HREF="#Trusted Third Party">trusted third party</a>
